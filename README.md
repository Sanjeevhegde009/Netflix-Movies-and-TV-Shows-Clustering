# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clustering


The Data set used in the project consists of Movies and TV shows available on Netflix as surveyed by Flixable, 3rd party Netflix search engine.The project has successfully analysed data set containing 7787 rows and 12 columns, with no duplicates. The data contained 69.1% movies and 30.9% TV shows, with the number of movies added each year falling since 2019. The USA, India, and the UK were the countries producing the most content on Netflix, and international movies, dramas, and comedies were the most common genres. Most content was rated as mature, followed by teen and family-friendly.

Further, dimensionality reduction has been performed using PCA. KMeans and Heirarchical Clustering have been used to cluster the data based on the textual fields in the data set. As per KMeans, 4 optimum clusters were created while Heirarchical clusteriing with threshold distance of 4 units created 9 clusters. Finally, a recommnedation system has been built using Cosine Similarity to provide top 10 similar content.
